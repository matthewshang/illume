![Cornell Box](renders/cornelllight-1440x1080-10000spp-15md.png?raw=true "Title")
Cornell box, showcasing reflection, refraction, caustics, and GI
![sss dragon](renders/hgdragonback4-1440x1080-4000spp-40md.png?raw=true "Title")
100k tri Stanford dragon model with moderate backscattering and a IOR of 1.68, making it kind of look like jade
![spheres](renders/spheres-1440x1080-15000spp-15md.png?raw=true "Title")
I tried to replicate the image on the wikipedia article for raytracing
![lucy(525k tris)](renders/lucy5-960x720-10000spp-10md.png?raw=true "Title")
BVH test. 525k tri model instead of 20m tri Lucy because it probably wouldn't fit on my GPU
![sss bunny](renders/sss-960x720-5000spp-45md.png?raw=true "Title")
Stanford bunny model with isotrophic scattering
